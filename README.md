# SillyTech3D

My first attempt at making a 3D (game) engine.

It should compile in MSVC2015, on Windows (going to port it!).


Featuring:
- Rendering of 3D models of different format
- Lua scripting
- Tweak menus for: Scene, Actors, Components, Settings
- Extended GLSL shaders, supporting #include
- OpenAL (some work left..)
- PhysX (far from done)


# Building the project
You will need Visual Studio 2015 and CMake in order to build this project.

1. Configure and generate project with CMake - make sure the directory can be written to (to prevent MSB3073 error)

2. Open the SillyTech3D solution file.

3. Build and run!
