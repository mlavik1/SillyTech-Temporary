# SillyTech3D

My first attempt at making a 3D (game) engine.

It should compile in MSVC2015, on Windows (going to port it!).


Featuring:
- Rendering of 3D models, from different format
. Lua scripting
- Tweak menus for: Scene, Actors, Components, Settings
- Extended GLSL shaders, supporting #include
- OpenAL (some work left..)
- PhysX (far from done)
